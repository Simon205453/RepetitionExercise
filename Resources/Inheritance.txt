What is inheritance
inheritance is a funciton that makes classes super- and sub- classes.
a super class also called parentclass, is a class that owns attributes and methods like any other class.
the subclass also called the childclass, inheritances the attributes and the methods given to the parent class.
makes the methods and attributes available for calls from main method, both from superclass and subclass.
this also means if the superclass gets added an extra attribute or method, the subclass will also contain the attribute and method.
Its easier to explain with example.
If we have a superclass called car, the car has attributes like weight, topspeed, price, ect.
we can then make a subclass called BMW, that inhertances the attributes from car class.
we can then add extra attributes for the BMW class, like modelname, limitedEdition, ect.
the BMWclass now contains all the attributes from parentclass and from its own class.
we can make multiple subclasses inheriting from a parentclass.
